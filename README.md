# Teamwork Weekly Task Report Automation

> C# console application that interacts with the Teamwork API to generate automated CSV reports summarizing tasks for the current week.

## Overview

This project is a personal tool built as a coding exercise to automate weekly task reporting using the Teamwork.com project management API.

It connects to Teamwork, retrieves task data, and outputs a structured .csv file summarizing current week's tasks â€” ready to open in Excel. The tool can be automated to run periodically using Windows Task Scheduler.

## Features

- Pulls tasks using Teamwork REST API
- Filters tasks by due date (this week's tasks)
- Extracts task title, assignee, due date, and status
- Saves to a readable `.csv` file
- Automatically runs every 10 minutes (via Windows Task Scheduler)

## Project Structure

```cbash
teamwork-weekly-report/
â”œâ”€â”€ Interfaces/
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/             // Pure data (properties only)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TaskItem.cs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TeamworkUser.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/           // Logic like API calls, file writing, etc.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TeamworkService.cs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CsvExporter.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Output/             // Generated CSV files
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ weekly_report.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ App.config          // Configuration: API key and Teamwork URL
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs          // Main logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## How It Works

1. **Reads configuration** (API key, Teamwork base URL)
2. **Calls the Teamwork API** to fetch tasks
3. **Filters tasks** to include only those due this week
4. **Writes a CSV file** with:
   - Person name
   - Task title
   - Due date
   - Status
5. **Can be scheduled to run automatically every 10 minutes** using Windows Task Scheduler.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martindocs/teamwork-weekly-report.git
cd teamwork-weekly-report
```

### 2. Add Your Teamwork Credentials
```json
{
  "Teamwork": {
    "ApiKey": "your_teamwork_api_key",
    "BaseUrl": "https://yourcompany.teamwork.com"
  }
}
```

### 3. Build and Run the App
```bash
dotnet run
```

## (Optional) Schedule It to Run Automatically
### 1. Build the app
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

### 2. Open Windows Task Scheduler
- Create a new task

- Set trigger: Every 10 minutes

- Set action: Run the .exe file from the publish folder

## What I Learned
- Using REST APIs in C# with HttpClient

- Parsing JSON responses

- Working with dates and time filtering

- Generating CSV files in C#

- Setting up Task Scheduler to automate a console app

- Structuring and documenting a real-world project

## Future Improvements
- Write to .xlsx with formatting

- Push reports to SharePoint or OneDrive

- Send summary via email to stakeholders

- Add logging and error handling

- Add per-user summaries or charts
