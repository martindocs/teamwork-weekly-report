# Teamwork Weekly Task Report Automation

> C# console app built to help my team get clearer weekly updates from Teamwork.

## Overview

This project started with a simple idea: make it easier for my engineering team to see what everyone's working on. We were using [Teamwork.com](https://www.teamwork.com)
, but with so many tasks flying around, it was hard for managers to get a clear weekly summary.

I thought â€” why not build a little tool that automates all of this?

I started by building a C# console app that:

* Connects to the Teamwork API
* Pulls task data
* Filters out only the useful stuff (like tasks tagged working-on)
* Saves it to a Excel `.xlsx` report

The app worked great. It pulled the data, formatted it nicely, and could even run on a schedule using Windows Task Scheduler.

But then I hit a wall.
Our IT department flagged it as a security risk (no .exe files allowed on servers), so the project couldnâ€™t go live internally.

So I pivoted.

Instead of dropping the idea, I rebuilt the report using Excel, with:

* Power Query to pull and transform data
* A clean and simple user interface
* A few VBA macros for added functionality

And it worked!
The Excel version ended up being even more feature-rich, and I delivered it to the engineering team.

So while the C# version became more of a portfolio project, the overall goal, making our task reporting clearer and easier was still achieved ðŸ’ª

## Features

- Pulls tasks using Teamwork REST API
- Filters tasks by due date 
- Extracts project name, task title, assignee, due date, and task progress
- Saves to a readable `.xlsx` file

## Project Structure

```cbash
teamwork-weekly-report/
â”œâ”€â”€ Properties/                 // Local settings
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/                     // Pure data (properties only)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Shared/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Teamwork/
â”œâ”€â”€ Output/                     // Generated Excel files 
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/                   // Logic like API calls, file writing, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ Test/                       // Dummy test files
â”œâ”€â”€ Utils/                      // Resuable logic used across app
â”œâ”€â”€ appsettings.Template.json   // Configuration: API key and Teamwork URL
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs                  // Main logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md

```

## How It Works

1. **Reads configuration** (API key, Teamwork base URL)
2. **Calls the Teamwork API** to fetch tasks
3. **Filters tasks** to include only those due this week
4. **Writes a Excel file** with:
   - Project name
   - Person name
   - Task title
   - Due date
   - Status

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martindocs/teamwork-weekly-report.git
cd teamwork-weekly-report
```

### 2. Add Your Teamwork Credentials
```json
{
  "Teamwork": {
    "ApiKey": "your_teamwork_api_key",
    "BaseUrl": "https://yourcompany.teamwork.com"
  }
}
```

### 3. Build and Run the App
```bash
dotnet run
```

## (Optional) Schedule It to Run Automatically
### 1. Build the app
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

### 2. Open Windows Task Scheduler
- Create a new task

- Set trigger: Every 10 minutes

- Set action: Run the .exe file from the publish folder

## What I Learned
- Using REST APIs in C# with HttpClient

- Parsing JSON responses

- Working with dates and time filtering

- Generating Excel files in C#

- Structuring and documenting a real-world project

## Future Improvements
- Push reports to SharePoint or OneDrive

- Send summary via email to stakeholders

- Add logging and error handling

- Add per-user summaries or charts

## Security & Privacy

* No sensitive credentials are included in this repo.

* API keys and secrets are handled via environment variables or local config files and never committed.

* Sample data and task identifiers are sanitized and generic. No private project data is stored or exposed.
